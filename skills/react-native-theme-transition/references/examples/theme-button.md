# Theme Button

A button with a static label that cycles through themes on tap.
Because the button's visuals don't depend on which theme is active,
you can call `setTheme` directly. No optimistic state, no effects,
no `preference` reads.

## Example

```tsx
import { Pressable, Text } from 'react-native'
import { useTheme } from '@/lib/theme'

const CYCLE = ['light', 'dark'] as const

export function ThemeButton() {
  const { theme, setTheme, isTransitioning } = useTheme()

  const currentIndex = CYCLE.findIndex((name) => name === theme.name)
  const next = CYCLE[(Math.max(0, currentIndex) + 1) % CYCLE.length]

  return (
    <Pressable
      disabled={isTransitioning}
      onPress={() => setTheme(next)}
      style={{
        padding: 16,
        borderRadius: 12,
        alignItems: 'center',
        backgroundColor: theme.colors.primary,
      }}
    >
      <Text style={{ color: '#fff', fontSize: 16, fontWeight: '600' }}>
        Switch theme
      </Text>
    </Pressable>
  )
}
```

> **Warning.** Don't dim the button based on `isTransitioning` (e.g.
> `opacity: isTransitioning ? 0.5 : 1`). The snapshot captures
> whatever is on screen, and a dimmed button will cross-fade with its
> own full-opacity version and produce a visible flash. Use
> `disabled` for interaction blocking; leave the styling alone.

## When the Trigger Doesn't Reflect the Active Theme

A plain "Switch theme" button, a programmatic call from an effect,
or a deep link (anything that doesn't need to highlight the *current*
option) can just call `setTheme` directly. No state, no effects.

See [Theme Picker](../examples/theme-picker.md) for the pattern when
you need to highlight the user's current pick. That one reads
`preference` from the hook.
