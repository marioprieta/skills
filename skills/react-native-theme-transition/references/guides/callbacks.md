# Callbacks

The library exposes three callbacks. The split is intentional.
`onTransitionStart` and `onTransitionEnd` are for animation
lifecycle; `onThemeChange` is for "the theme is now X". Use
`onThemeChange` as the single source of truth for persistence and
analytics; it is the only one guaranteed to fire on every code path.

## Animated Transition

```text
1. setTheme('dark') runs; touches are blocked
2. config.onTransitionStart(name)      ← first
3. options.onTransitionStart(name)     ← per-call, after config
4. snapshot captured, overlay mounted
5. colors swapped under the overlay
6. animation runs (duration ms)
7. animation ends (setTimeout matched to duration)
8. config.onTransitionEnd(name)        ← first
9. options.onTransitionEnd(name)       ← per-call, after config
10. config.onThemeChange(name)         ← always last
11. next render: isTransitioning → false
```

## Instant Switch

```ts
setTheme('dark', { animated: false })
```

```text
1. colors swap immediately
2. config.onThemeChange(name)
```

No start, no end, no touch blocking, no snapshot. Only
`onThemeChange` fires.

## System-Driven Change

OS appearance changes go through the same paths as user-initiated
calls.

- **Foreground.** Full animated transition.
- **Background or returning to foreground.** Instant switch.

`onThemeChange` fires in both cases. `onTransitionStart` and
`onTransitionEnd` only fire for the foreground (animated) path.

## Capture Failure Fallback

If the Skia snapshot fails (out of memory, unmounted view, GPU
hiccup), the library falls back to an instant switch. But
`onTransitionStart` has already fired by then.

```text
1. config.onTransitionStart(name)      ← already fired
2. snapshot FAILS
3. colors swap immediately
4. config.onThemeChange(name)
```

> **Warning.** `onTransitionEnd` does **not** fire on capture failure. Write
> your `onTransitionStart` handlers so they are safe to run without
> a matching end. Release any haptic engine references, clear any
> state, and rely on `onThemeChange` for "the change is committed"
> side effects.

## Summary

| Callback | Animated | Instant | System foreground | System background | Capture failure |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `config.onTransitionStart` | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ (already fired) |
| `options.onTransitionStart` | ✅ | ❌ | n/a | n/a | ✅ (already fired) |
| `config.onTransitionEnd` | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `options.onTransitionEnd` | ✅ | ❌ | n/a | n/a | ❌ |
| `config.onThemeChange` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
