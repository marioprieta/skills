# Troubleshooting

Each entry follows the same shape: what you're seeing, what's
actually happening underneath, and the smallest change that fixes it.
If your issue isn't here, search the
[GitHub issues](https://github.com/marioprieta/react-native-theme-transition/issues)
or open a new one with a minimal repro.

## Picker Doesn't Highlight the 'system' Row

**Symptom.** The `'system'` option never highlights, even after you
tap it. `light` and `dark` work fine.

**Cause.** You're driving the highlight from `theme.name`.
`theme.name` is always the concrete painted theme. When the user
picks `'system'` it resolves to `'light'` or `'dark'`, and the
`'system'` row can never win the comparison.

**Fix.** Compare against `preference`. It carries the raw value
the user passed to `setTheme` (including `'system'`) and updates
synchronously, so the highlight repaints before the snapshot.

```tsx
const { preference, setTheme, isTransitioning } = useTheme()

<Pressable
  disabled={isTransitioning}
  onPress={() => setTheme('system')}
  style={{ opacity: preference === 'system' ? 1 : 0.5 }}
/>
```

See the [theme vs preference decision table](../api/use-theme.md#theme-vs-preference)
for every case.

## Native Switch Flickers in the Snapshot

**Symptom.** On iOS, a native `<Switch>` thumb is caught mid-slide in
the snapshot.

**Cause.** iOS `UISwitch` runs a ~250 ms Core Animation with no
completion callback. The snapshot is taken while the thumb is still
moving.

**Fix.** Use a [custom toggle](../examples/theme-toggle.md) built with
plain React styles. Optimistic state updates paint in the same commit,
so the snapshot catches the final position.

## Overlay Stays Visible / App Frozen

**Symptom.** A transition starts but the overlay never goes away, or
the app feels stuck.

**Check.**

- The Metro console for `[react-native-theme-transition] Failed to capture` warnings.
- That `@shopify/react-native-skia` is installed (`npx expo doctor`).
- That `ThemeTransitionProvider` actually wraps the visible tree.
- That `react-native-worklets/plugin` is the **last** entry in your `babel.config.js`.

## Theme Change Is Instant Instead of Animated

**Symptom.** No animation. The colors just snap.

**Causes.**

1. `animated: false` set per call or at config level.
2. `@shopify/react-native-skia` missing or not installed for your platform. The snapshot throws and the library falls back to instant.
3. `ThemeTransitionProvider` is not wrapping the visible tree.
4. `react-native-worklets/plugin` is missing or not last in `babel.config.js`.

Restart with `npx expo start -c` after fixing.

## Reveal Starts From the Wrong Place

**Symptom.** `circularReveal`, `heart`, or `star` always starts from
the screen center, no matter where you tapped.

**Cause.** The `origin` ref had unmounted by the time the snapshot
ran, or the view it pointed to was outside the provider, so
`measure()` came back empty and the library fell back to screen
center.

**Fix.** Pass an explicit `{ x, y }`, or make sure the ref survives
until `onTransitionEnd`:

```tsx
const buttonRef = useRef<View>(null)

<Pressable
  ref={buttonRef}
  onPress={() => setTheme('dark', { transition: 'circularReveal', origin: buttonRef })}
/>
```

## iOS Safe-Area Background Doesn't Follow the Theme

**Symptom.** On iOS, the top status-bar area and the bottom home-bar
area stay light (or dark) regardless of the active theme. The middle
content is themed correctly.

**Cause.** `react-native-screens` paints an opaque
`UINavigationController` background in the safe-area zones using the
OS system color, covering the provider's wrapper background.

**Fix.** Wrap your navigation tree with `ThemeProvider` from
`@react-navigation/native`. React Navigation's native-stack reads
`colors.background` from that provider via `useTheme()` and applies
it to every Screen automatically. See
[Expo Router](../recipes/expo-router.md) for the canonical pattern.

## Android: Light Strip Behind Scrolled Content

**Symptom.** Content below the fold of a root `ScrollView` briefly
flashes the old theme's background during a transition. iOS is fine.

**Cause.** Android `ScrollView` caches `backgroundColor` in its
drawing cache. When you set it on the `ScrollView`'s `style`, only
the visible rect invalidates on a theme change. Off-screen content
keeps the old color until you scroll.

**Fix.** Put the background on `contentContainerStyle`, not `style`:

```tsx
<ScrollView
  style={{ flex: 1 }}
  contentContainerStyle={{
backgroundColor: theme.colors.background,
minHeight: '100%',
  }}
/>
```

The same rule applies to `FlatList` and `SectionList`.

## Fast Refresh Issues

**Symptom.** After a save during development, the overlay stays up or
system mode stops following the OS.

**Cause.** Fast Refresh reloads JS but leaves native state alone. If
a transition was in flight when you saved, the cleanup never runs.

**Fix.** Full reload (`Cmd+R` on iOS Simulator, `R R` on Android).
Development only; never happens in production builds.

## Theme Picker Is Missing New Transition Types

**Fix.** Import the list instead of hardcoding it:

```tsx
import { TRANSITION_TYPES } from 'react-native-theme-transition'

{TRANSITION_TYPES.map((t) => (
  <Pressable key={t} onPress={() => setTheme('dark', { transition: t })}>
<Text>{t}</Text>
  </Pressable>
))}
```

`TRANSITION_TYPES` is derived from the internal registry. Adding a
new transition kind to the library updates this array
automatically.

## System Theme Not Following OS

**Causes.**

1. You never entered system mode. Call `setTheme('system')` or pass `initialTheme="system"`.
2. A later `setTheme('dark')` exited system mode. Re-enter with `setTheme('system')`.
3. Custom theme names without `systemThemeMap`. Add one, or rename your themes to `'light'` and `'dark'`.
4. iOS Simulator. Toggle appearance with `Cmd + Shift + A`.

## TypeScript Errors on Color Tokens

**Symptom.** `Property 'myToken' does not exist on type '{ ... }'`.

**Cause.** All themes must share identical keys; the type inference
fails when one theme has a token the others don't.

**Fix.**

```ts
const light = { background: '#fff', text: '#000' }
const dark: Record<keyof typeof light, string> = {
  background: '#000',
  text: '#fff',
}
```

The `Record<keyof typeof light, string>` annotation makes TypeScript
enforce key parity at definition time, so the error surfaces in the
theme file rather than at every usage site.

## `setTheme` Returns `'ignored'`

`setTheme` returns `'accepted' | 'ignored'`. It returns `'ignored'`
when:

1. You asked for the same preference that's already active.
2. A transition is already running.

Wait until `isTransitioning` is `false` before retrying. The library
already blocks touch input during the animation, so the user cannot
trigger a second call themselves. This only matters for programmatic
callers.

## Double Transition on App Start

**Symptom.** The app shows one theme briefly, then transitions to the
stored preference.

**Cause.** `initialTheme` resolves to one theme, then a bridge
component calls `setTheme` with a different stored preference.

**Fix.** Pass the stored preference directly as `initialTheme`:

```tsx
const colorMode = useThemeStore((s) => s.colorMode)
<ThemeTransitionProvider initialTheme={colorMode}>
```

## iOS 26 Liquid Glass Containers Freeze Mid-Transition

**Symptom.** An `expo-glass-effect` `GlassView` (or
`@callstack/liquid-glass`, or any iOS 26 liquid glass container)
used as app-level content stays frozen during the animation and
snaps to its new appearance at the end. On `light → dark` the
card looks whitish for the whole fade, then jumps.

**Cause.** Skia's `makeImageFromView` captures through UIKit's
`drawViewHierarchyInRect:afterScreenUpdates:YES`, which bakes
the current `UIVisualEffectView` state into the bitmap. Liquid
glass needs that view alive to do real-time lensing, specular
highlights, and ambient refraction. Once those effects are
frozen into a texture, they can't keep running. It's not a bug
inside the snapshot path, it's how iOS 26 composites glass.

**What still works.**

- **Native tab bars, native-stack headers (including iOS 26's
  liquid-glass headers), and system sheet backdrops.** The OS
  composites these outside the snapshot path, so they animate
  correctly.
- **`BlurView` from `expo-blur`.** The classic `UIBlurEffect`
  does no lensing or highlights, so frozen pixels look right the
  whole way through.

**Fix.** For app-level glass (hero cards, large glass panels in
the middle of the viewport), use `BlurView`, use the system
glass on tab bars and nav headers, or paint the surface with a
solid theme token. Reserve `GlassView` for places that don't
need to animate through a theme change.

Proper support would mean mounting live `GlassView`s above the
Skia overlay during the animation (a "transient re-hosted glass
layer"). Possible in theory, hard in practice. The biggest
blocker is that Reanimated's `measure()` on Fabric doesn't
return `borderRadius` or transforms, so the transient copy can't
match the original without extra registration boilerplate. Modal
`UIWindow`s and GPU cost on dense glass layouts make it worse.

## Duplicate Plugin / Preset Detected

From Expo SDK 55+, `babel-preset-expo` already includes
`react-native-reanimated/plugin`. Remove it from your plugins list:

```js title="babel.config.js"
plugins: [
  'react-native-worklets/plugin', // must be last
]
```
