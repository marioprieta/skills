# Getting Started

`react-native-theme-transition` ships as a pure JavaScript / TypeScript
package. Installing it means installing the package itself plus three
peer dependencies that handle the heavy lifting: `@shopify/react-native-skia`
(snapshot capture and rendering), `react-native-reanimated` (the
animation driver), and `react-native-worklets` (the worklet runtime
Reanimated 4 builds on).

## Installation

**Expo (SDK 54+):**

Reanimated and Skia ship with modern Expo SDKs, so you don't need
to install Reanimated separately.

```bash
npx expo install react-native-theme-transition @shopify/react-native-skia react-native-worklets
```

> **Note.** **Expo SDK 55+:** the blank template no longer bundles
> `babel-preset-expo`. If your project doesn't have a
> `babel.config.js` yet, install it:
> `npx expo install babel-preset-expo`.

**Expo (SDK < 54):**

```bash
npx expo install react-native-theme-transition @shopify/react-native-skia react-native-reanimated react-native-worklets
```

**React Native CLI:**

```bash
npm install react-native-theme-transition @shopify/react-native-skia react-native-reanimated react-native-worklets
```

Then install the iOS pods:

```bash
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

## Tested Versions

The peer dependency minimums in `package.json` are the lowest
versions the library is built to support, but day-to-day development
and CI run against a tighter, modern set:

| Peer | Declared minimum | Tested against |
|---|---|---|
| `react` | `>=19.0.0` | `19.2.0` |
| `react-native` | `>=0.78.0` | `0.83.x` |
| `@shopify/react-native-skia` | `>=2.0.0` | `2.4.x` |
| `react-native-reanimated` | `>=4.0.0` | `4.2.x` |
| `react-native-worklets` | `>=0.5.0` | `0.7.x` |

If you hit a real bug on the declared minimums, please file an
issue with your exact lockfile versions. The minimums are kept
honest by the published peer ranges, not by a continuous test
matrix.

## Bare React Native CLI: Verify the New Architecture

Skia 2 and Reanimated 4 require React Native's New Architecture
(Fabric + TurboModules). On React Native 0.78+ it is enabled by
default. Expo SDK 54+ already enables it for managed apps.

Bare React Native CLI projects upgraded from older versions can
still have the old architecture wired in. Confirm before installing:

- **iOS**: `ios/Podfile` should not pin `:fabric_enabled => false`.
- **Android**: `android/gradle.properties` should have `newArchEnabled=true`.

If either is off, enable it and run a clean install (`pod install`,
Gradle sync). Without the New Architecture the build fails with
errors that mention `RCTFabric` or `TurboModule`.

## Configure Babel

Add `react-native-worklets/plugin` as the **last** plugin in your
`babel.config.js`:

```js title="babel.config.js"
module.exports = function (api) {
  api.cache(true)
  return {
presets: ['babel-preset-expo'],
plugins: [
  // SDK 55+: do NOT add 'react-native-reanimated/plugin'.
  // babel-preset-expo already includes it from SDK 55 onwards.
  // SDK 54 and below: you DO need 'react-native-reanimated/plugin' here.
  'react-native-worklets/plugin', // must be last
],
  }
}
```

## Clear Cache and Restart

```bash
npx expo start -c
```

## Verify The Install

The fastest way to confirm the install is healthy: open
`src/lib/theme.ts` in a fresh file and import the factory. If
TypeScript autocompletes the `createThemeTransition` symbol and the
Metro log shows no warnings about missing native modules, the
install is good.

```ts title="lib/theme.ts"
import { createThemeTransition } from 'react-native-theme-transition'

export const { ThemeTransitionProvider, useTheme } = createThemeTransition({
  themes: {
light: { background: '#ffffff', text: '#000000' },
dark: { background: '#000000', text: '#ffffff' },
  },
})
```

If Metro complains about `@shopify/react-native-skia` or
`react-native-worklets`, see [Troubleshooting](./guides/troubleshooting.md).
The most common cause is forgetting to clear the Metro cache after
adding the worklets babel plugin.
