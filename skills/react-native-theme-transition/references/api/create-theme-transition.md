# createThemeTransition

`createThemeTransition` validates your configuration at
initialization and returns a provider to wrap your app and a
`useTheme` hook to read and change the active theme. Both are typed
against your theme map. Each call creates an isolated instance, so
multiple theme scopes can coexist in the same app.

TypeScript infers theme names and token keys from `config.themes`,
so the returned `useTheme` and `setTheme` are fully typed against
your themes with no manual generics.

## Reference

```ts
import { createThemeTransition } from 'react-native-theme-transition'

const { ThemeTransitionProvider, useTheme } = createThemeTransition({
  themes: { light, dark },
  transition: 'circularReveal',
  onThemeChange: (name) => analytics.track('theme_switch', { theme: name }),
})
```

## Arguments

`createThemeTransition` takes a single `config` object.

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `themes` | `Record<string, ThemeDefinition>` | *required* | All theme definitions keyed by name. Every theme must share the same token keys. `'system'` is reserved. |
| `animated` | `boolean` | `true` | Global default for animated switches. When `false`, every `setTheme` call switches instantly unless the caller passes `{ animated: true }`. |
| `transition` | `TransitionType` | `'fade'` | Default transition kind when `setTheme` is called without a `transition` option. |
| `systemThemeMap` | `{ light: Names; dark: Names }` | — | Maps OS appearance to your theme names. Required when your themes are not literally named `'light'` and `'dark'` and you want to use `'system'` mode. |
| `darkThemes` | `Names[]` | `[systemThemeMap.dark]` or `['dark']` | Theme names that register as a dark color scheme with the OS. The library calls `Appearance.setColorScheme` internally to keep native UI in sync. |
| `onTransitionStart` | `(name) => void` | — | Called when an animated transition begins, before snapshot capture. Skipped for instant switches. |
| `onTransitionEnd` | `(name) => void` | — | Called after an animated transition completes. Skipped for instant switches and capture-failure fallbacks. |
| `onThemeChange` | `(name) => void` | — | Called on every theme change: animated, instant, or system-driven. The only callback guaranteed to fire. |

> **Note.** `duration` is intentionally **not** a config field. Each transition
> kind has its own per-kind default tuned for that family's feel. A
> single global override would flatten that calibration. Pass
> `duration` per call via `setTheme(name, { duration })` instead.

## Returns

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ThemeTransitionProvider` | `Component` | React provider that supplies animated theme colors via context. See [ThemeTransitionProvider](../api/provider.md) for placement rules and nesting examples. |
| `useTheme` | `() => UseThemeResult` | Hook that returns the painted theme, the user's preference, the mutator, and the transition flag. See [useTheme](../api/use-theme.md). |

## Example

```ts title="lib/theme.ts"
import { createThemeTransition } from 'react-native-theme-transition'

const light = {
  background: '#ffffff',
  card:       '#f5f5f5',
  text:       '#000000',
  primary:    '#007AFF',
}

const dark: Record<keyof typeof light, string> = {
  background: '#000000',
  card:       '#1c1c1e',
  text:       '#ffffff',
  primary:    '#0A84FF',
}

export const { ThemeTransitionProvider, useTheme } = createThemeTransition({
  themes: { light, dark },
  transition: 'circularReveal',
})
```

```tsx title="app/_layout.tsx"
import { ThemeTransitionProvider } from '@/lib/theme'

export default function RootLayout() {
  return (
    <ThemeTransitionProvider initialTheme="system">
      <App />
    </ThemeTransitionProvider>
  )
}
```

## Common Configurations

Four patterns cover almost every real app. Find the one closest to
your case and copy it as a starting point.

### Minimal

The smallest legal config. Two themes, default fade transition, no
system mode integration. Great for prototyping.

```ts
createThemeTransition({
  themes: { light, dark },
})
```

You get: 350 ms fade, `theme.scheme` derived from `dark` being a
dark theme, OS native UI follows the active theme via
`Appearance.setColorScheme`. `setTheme('system')` works because the
themes are literally named `'light'` and `'dark'`.

### Standard

What the [Quick Start](../quick-start.md) shows. Adds an explicit
default transition.

```ts
createThemeTransition({
  themes: { light, dark },
  transition: 'circularReveal',
})
```

Same as Minimal, plus every `setTheme` call animates with a circular
reveal unless the caller overrides `transition` per call.

### Custom Theme Names

When your themes are not named `'light'` and `'dark'`, the library
cannot infer which one to use for system mode on its own. Provide
`systemThemeMap` to tell it.

```ts
createThemeTransition({
  themes: { sunrise, midnight },
  systemThemeMap: { light: 'sunrise', dark: 'midnight' },
})
```

`darkThemes` defaults to `[systemThemeMap.dark]` (`['midnight']`
here), so `theme.scheme === 'dark'` reports `true` only when
`midnight` is active. Without `systemThemeMap`, `setTheme('system')`
and `initialTheme="system"` both throw at the first resolve.

### Multiple Dark Themes

When two or more of your themes should register as dark with the OS
(for example, a regular dark theme plus an OLED-optimized one),
list them explicitly in `darkThemes`.

```ts
createThemeTransition({
  themes: { light, dark, midnight, ocean },
  systemThemeMap: { light: 'light', dark: 'dark' },
  darkThemes: ['dark', 'midnight', 'ocean'],
  onThemeChange: (name) => analytics.track('theme_switch', { theme: name }),
})
```

`theme.scheme === 'dark'` now reports `true` for any of `dark`,
`midnight`, or `ocean`. `Appearance.setColorScheme('dark')` fires
when any of them are active, so iOS alerts and the system keyboard
stay in dark. `systemThemeMap.dark` still picks the canonical dark
theme (`'dark'`) when the OS is dark and the user is in system mode.

## Theme Definitions

Every theme must share the exact same set of token keys. Mismatches
throw at initialization. The order of keys within a theme does not
matter.

```ts
const light = { bg: '#fff', text: '#000', primary: '#007AFF' }

// Type-safe enforcement of matching keys on secondary themes:
const dark: Record<keyof typeof light, string> = {
  bg: '#000', text: '#fff', primary: '#0A84FF',
}
```

### Rules

- At least one theme is required.
- `'system'` is reserved. It cannot be used as a theme key.
- All themes must share an identical key set.

## `systemThemeMap`

Maps the OS color scheme to your theme names. Required when your
themes are not literally named `'light'` and `'dark'` and you want
to use `'system'` mode (either via `initialTheme="system"` or
`setTheme('system')`).

```ts
createThemeTransition({
  themes: { sunrise, midnight, ocean },
  systemThemeMap: { light: 'sunrise', dark: 'midnight' },
})
```

Both `light` and `dark` must be provided, and both values must
reference existing theme names.

## `darkThemes`

The library calls `Appearance.setColorScheme` so native UI elements
(alerts, date pickers, keyboards) match the active theme.
`darkThemes` tells it which of your themes register as a dark color
scheme.

```ts
createThemeTransition({
  themes: { light, dark, ocean, rose },
  darkThemes: ['dark', 'ocean'],
  systemThemeMap: { light: 'light', dark: 'dark' },
})
```

Defaults to `[systemThemeMap.dark]` when `systemThemeMap` is
provided, otherwise `['dark']`. In system mode the library uses
`Appearance.setColorScheme('unspecified')` so the OS drives native
appearance.

`darkThemes` must contain at least one entry when supplied. Passing
an empty array throws at initialization to prevent a silent
misconfiguration where every theme would register as light with the
OS and break native UI elements (alerts, date pickers, status bar
contrast). Omit the field instead to fall back to the default.

> **Warning.** Do not call `Appearance.setColorScheme` yourself. The library
> tracks system mode through that call. Manual writes desync it on
> Android, and the next `setTheme('system')` will misbehave.

## Reduced Motion

The library does not honor OS Reduce Motion automatically. It is
policy-free on accessibility. If you want to respect the system
setting, read it yourself and pass `animated: false` per call.

```ts
import { AccessibilityInfo } from 'react-native'

const reduced = await AccessibilityInfo.isReduceMotionEnabled()
setTheme('dark', reduced ? { animated: false } : undefined)
```

## Validation Errors

`createThemeTransition` throws at initialization when the config is
invalid. The most common cases:

| Error | Cause |
|---|---|
| `\`themes\` must contain at least one theme.` | `themes` is empty. |
| `\`"system"\` is a reserved name…` | `themes` contains a key named `'system'`. |
| `Theme "X" has different token keys than "Y".` | Theme `X` is missing or adding keys vs the reference theme. |
| `\`transition\` must be one of: …` | `config.transition` is not a recognized transition kind. |
| `\`systemThemeMap\` must provide both \`light\` and \`dark\` keys.` | One of the keys is missing. |
| `\`systemThemeMap.X\` refers to "Y" which does not exist…` | The mapped name is not a theme key. |
| `\`darkThemes\` refers to "X" which does not exist…` | An entry in `darkThemes` is not a theme key. |
| `\`darkThemes\` cannot be an empty array.` | `darkThemes: []` was supplied. Omit the field instead to use the default. |

`setTheme` validates its options at every call and throws on
out-of-range numeric inputs. See
[setTheme runtime errors](../api/use-theme.md#runtime-errors).
