# ThemeTransitionProvider

Wraps your app tree and provides the theme context. Place as high as possible
in the component tree: above navigation, above modals. The screenshot captures
everything inside the provider's root `View`.

```tsx
<ThemeTransitionProvider initialTheme="system">
  <App />
</ThemeTransitionProvider>
```

## Props

| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `children` | `ReactNode` | yes | Your application tree |
| `initialTheme` | `ThemeName \| 'system'` | yes | Theme for the first frame |

## Initial theme behavior

- Read once when the provider first mounts. If a parent re-renders and passes a different `initialTheme`, the provider ignores it. To change themes after mount, call `setTheme()`
- `'system'` reads OS appearance synchronously (zero flash) and subscribes to changes
- With custom names: requires `systemThemeMap` in config, otherwise throws
- An explicit theme name (e.g. `'dark'`) does not subscribe to OS changes

## Placement

Content outside the provider won't be included in the transition screenshot.

```tsx
// Correct: navigation inside provider
<ThemeTransitionProvider initialTheme="system">
  <NavigationContainer>
    ...
  </NavigationContainer>
</ThemeTransitionProvider>
```

```tsx
// Wrong: provider inside navigation, only captures current screen
<NavigationContainer>
  <ThemeTransitionProvider initialTheme="system">
    ...
  </ThemeTransitionProvider>
</NavigationContainer>
```

> **Warning.** Bottom sheets (e.g. `@gorhom/bottom-sheet`) must be inside the provider so
> their backdrop is captured in the screenshot. React Native's built-in `Modal`
> renders in a separate native window and won't be captured.
