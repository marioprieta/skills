# useTheme

`useTheme` returns the painted theme, the user's preference, the
`setTheme` mutator, and an `isTransitioning` flag. It throws if
called outside a `ThemeTransitionProvider`.

## Reference

```ts
const { theme, preference, setTheme, isTransitioning } = useTheme()
```

The hook is created by [createThemeTransition](../api/create-theme-transition.md)
and is fully typed against your theme map. `theme.name`,
`theme.colors`, and `setTheme`'s argument all narrow to the names
you defined in `themes`.

## Returns

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `theme.name` | `Names` | The theme currently painted on screen. Always concrete. Never `'system'`. |
| `theme.colors` | `Record<Token, string>` | Resolved color tokens for the painted theme. |
| `theme.scheme` | `'light' \| 'dark'` | Binary classification, derived from `darkThemes`. |
| `preference` | `Names \| 'system'` | What the user explicitly picked. Mirrors the last value passed to `setTheme`. |
| `isTransitioning` | `boolean` | `true` while a transition overlay is visible. |
| `setTheme` | `(name, opts?) => 'accepted' \| 'ignored'` | Change the user's preference. See [setTheme](#settheme) below. |

## Theme vs Preference

The hook exposes two related but distinct values, and choosing the
right one matters.

- **`theme`** describes what is currently painted on screen.
  `theme.name` is always concrete (never `'system'`). When the user
  picks `'system'`, the library resolves it via
  [systemThemeMap](../api/create-theme-transition.md#systemthememap)
  and exposes the result here.
- **`preference`** describes what the user explicitly picked. It can
  be `'system'`. It mirrors the last argument passed to `setTheme`.

### Decision Table

| You want to | Read | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Style a component | `theme.colors.*` | Real values, resolved. |
| `StatusBar` content style and `isDark` checks | `theme.scheme` | Binary, regardless of theme count. |
| Toggle dark to light | `theme.name` | Always concrete, works in system mode. |
| Per-theme asset (e.g. `logos[name]`) | `theme.name` | Always a real theme key. |
| Analytics for what was rendered | `theme.name` | The painted theme. |
| Theme picker highlight | `preference` | Must be able to show `'system'` as selected. |
| Analytics for what the user picked | `preference` | Carries intent, including `'system'`. |
| Persist the user's choice | `preference` | Restore the same intent on the next launch. |

### Common Mistakes

**Don't** compare picker rows against `theme.name`.

```tsx
// Wrong. theme.name is always concrete; the 'system' row never lights up.
options.map((option) => (
  <Pressable style={{ opacity: theme.name === option ? 1 : 0.5 }} />
))
```

**Do** compare them against `preference`.

```tsx
// Right. preference can be 'system'.
options.map((option) => (
  <Pressable style={{ opacity: preference === option ? 1 : 0.5 }} />
))
```

**Don't** toggle dark to light against `preference`.

```tsx
// Wrong. When the user is in system mode, preference === 'system'
// and this branch sends them to 'light' even if the OS is currently dark.
setTheme(preference === 'dark' ? 'light' : 'dark')
```

**Do** toggle against `theme.name`.

```tsx
// Right. theme.name tracks what's painted, even in system mode.
setTheme(theme.name === 'dark' ? 'light' : 'dark')
```

## Example

```tsx title="components/Card.tsx"
import { Pressable, Text, View } from 'react-native'
import { useTheme } from '@/lib/theme'

export function Card() {
  const { theme, preference, setTheme, isTransitioning } = useTheme()

  return (
    <View style={{ backgroundColor: theme.colors.background, padding: 16 }}>
      <Text style={{ color: theme.colors.text }}>
        Painted: {theme.name}
      </Text>
      <Text style={{ color: theme.colors.textSecondary }}>
        Preference: {preference}
      </Text>
      <Pressable
        disabled={isTransitioning}
        onPress={() => setTheme(theme.name === 'dark' ? 'light' : 'dark')}
      >
        <Text style={{ color: theme.colors.primary }}>Toggle</Text>
      </Pressable>
    </View>
  )
}
```

## `setTheme`

```ts
setTheme(name, options?): 'accepted' | 'ignored'
```

Changes the user's preference. The new preference is reflected
synchronously in subsequent reads of `preference`, so picker UIs
that highlight against it can repaint before the snapshot is
captured.

### Arguments

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | `Names \| 'system'` | Concrete theme name, or `'system'` to follow the OS appearance. |
| `options` | `SetThemeOptions` | Optional per-call configuration. See [SetThemeOptions](../types.md#setthemeoptions) for every variant and field. |

### Returns

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `'accepted'` | The library will apply the change, instantly or via an animated transition. |
| `'ignored'` | A transition is already in flight, or the call targets the same preference that's already active. |

Most callers can discard the return value. `isTransitioning` and the
configured callbacks cover the common cases. The discriminated
string is there for telemetry callers who want to know explicitly
whether a call did anything.

### Common Options

```ts
// Default fade.
setTheme('dark')

// Circular reveal from a button ref.
setTheme('dark', { transition: 'circularReveal', origin: buttonRef })

// Wipe right (new theme enters from the left edge).
setTheme('dark', { transition: 'wipe', direction: 'right', duration: 500 })

// Split closing inward like shutters.
setTheme('dark', { transition: 'split', mode: 'top-bottom', inverted: true })

// Pixelize with a chunkier mosaic at the peak.
setTheme('dark', { transition: 'pixelize', blockSize: 40 })

// Instant switch (no snapshot, no overlay).
setTheme('dark', { animated: false })
```

## `isTransitioning`

`true` from just after the snapshot is captured until the animation
completes. Use it to disable interactive controls so a second call
can't be queued mid-transition.

```tsx
<Pressable disabled={isTransitioning} onPress={() => setTheme('dark')}>
  <Text>Dark</Text>
</Pressable>
```

> **Note.** Touch input is also blocked internally from the moment `setTheme`
> is called, even before `isTransitioning` flips, since the snapshot
> hasn't been captured yet. The flag is there for visual feedback
> like `disabled={isTransitioning}`. The library protects you from
> the race.

## Picker Pattern

`preference` updates synchronously inside `setTheme`, so pickers can
highlight against it directly. No local `picked` state is needed.
The engine waits one frame before capturing the snapshot, which
gives React time to commit and paint the new highlight.

```tsx
import { Pressable, Text, View } from 'react-native'
import { useTheme } from '@/lib/theme'

const OPTIONS = ['light', 'dark', 'system'] as const

export function ThemePicker() {
  const { theme, preference, setTheme, isTransitioning } = useTheme()

  return (
    <View style={{ flexDirection: 'row', gap: 8 }}>
      {OPTIONS.map((option) => (
        <Pressable
          key={option}
          disabled={isTransitioning}
          onPress={() => setTheme(option)}
          style={{
            backgroundColor:
              preference === option ? theme.colors.primary : theme.colors.surface,
          }}
        >
          <Text style={{ color: theme.colors.text }}>{option}</Text>
        </Pressable>
      ))}
    </View>
  )
}
```

See [Theme Picker](../examples/theme-picker.md) for the
persisted-state variation.

## Runtime Errors

`setTheme` validates its numeric options at every call and throws a
descriptive `Error` if any value is out of range. The check runs
before the same-theme and in-flight guards, so misuse fails fast at
the call site instead of producing a silently broken animation.

| Error | Cause |
|---|---|
| `` `duration` must be a non-negative finite number `` | `duration` is negative, `NaN`, or `Infinity`. |
| `` `blockSize` must be a finite number >= 2 `` | `blockSize` is below `2`, `NaN`, or `Infinity`. |
| `` `noiseSize` must be a finite number >= 1 `` | `noiseSize` is below `1`, `NaN`, or `Infinity`. |
| `` `origin` coordinates must be finite numbers `` | An explicit `origin` point has a `NaN` or `Infinity` coordinate. (Refs are validated at measurement time and fall back to the screen center if measurement fails.) |

These validations are intentionally strict because the affected
values feed shaders and geometry math where silent `NaN` propagation
produces empty or visually broken transitions instead of a useful
crash.

## Behavior Rules

1. **Same preference.** Returns `'ignored'`.
2. **Already transitioning.** Returns `'ignored'`. Wait for `isTransitioning` to become `false` before retrying.
3. **`'system'`.** Enters system-following mode and subscribes to OS changes. `preference` becomes `'system'`, while `theme.name` holds the OS-resolved concrete theme.
4. **Concrete name.** Exits system-following mode.
5. **`animated: false`.** Instant switch. Only `onThemeChange` fires.
6. **Snapshot capture failure.** Falls back to an instant switch. `onThemeChange` still fires, but `onTransitionEnd` does not.
