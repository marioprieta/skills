# Overview

`react-native-theme-transition` brings animated theme switching to
React Native. It snapshots the current screen, swaps your theme
underneath, and animates the snapshot away with one of nine styles.
Built on Skia and Reanimated, both bundled in modern Expo SDKs (54+),
so it works in Expo Go without a prebuild.

## Highlights

- **Nine transition styles.** `fade`, `circularReveal`, `heart`,
  `star`, `wipe`, `slide`, `split`, `pixelize`, `dissolve`.
  Reveal-style transitions support an `inverted` variant.
- **Expo Go ready.** Works with Expo SDK 54+ out of the box. Bare
  React Native CLI also supported.
- **Full TypeScript inference.** `useTheme()` and `setTheme()` know
  your theme names and color tokens without manual generics.
- **System theme built in.** Follows OS appearance with zero-flash
  startup. `preference` and `theme` are kept separate so pickers
  and persistence work correctly.
- **Strict runtime validation.** Invalid options throw immediately
  with clear error messages.
- **React Compiler compatible.** All hooks follow the
  [Rules of React](https://react.dev/reference/rules).

## How It Compares

| Feature | react-native-theme-transition | react-native-theme-switch-animation | Uniwind Pro | Unistyles 3 |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Animated transitions | 9 styles | Fade or circular reveal | Native snapshot | None (instant) |
| Expo Go support | Yes | No (prebuild) | No (prebuild) | No (prebuild) |
| Execution | Skia and Reanimated | Native modules | C++ engine | C++ (ShadowTree) |
| Theme state management | Provider and typed hooks | Bring your own | Built-in | Built-in |
| TypeScript generics | Deep inference | Basic | Auto-generated | Manual override |
| System theme listener | Built-in | Not included | Built-in | Adaptive themes |
| Price | Free (MIT) | Free (MIT) | $99 / seat / year | Free (MIT) |

## Trade-Offs

- **No interaction during transitions.** Touches, scrolls, and
  additional `setTheme` calls are blocked while the animation is
  running. Use `isTransitioning` to disable buttons visually.
- **Static overlay.** The transition renders a captured snapshot,
  so dynamic content (videos, live counters) appears frozen for the
  duration of the animation.
- **No built-in Reduce Motion handling.** The library is
  policy-free on accessibility. If you want to honor the OS Reduce
  Motion setting, call `setTheme(name, { animated: false })` from
  your own wrapper.
