# Expo Router

The canonical setup uses three providers nested in the right order:
`ThemeTransitionProvider` (this library, captures the screen for
transitions), `ThemeProvider` from `@react-navigation/native`
(propagates your theme to React Navigation's native UI), and Expo
Router's `Stack`. Drop the snippet below into `app/_layout.tsx` and
adjust the `@/lib/theme` import to match your project structure
(e.g. `./lib/theme` or `../theme` if you don't use path aliases).

```tsx title="app/_layout.tsx"
import { useMemo } from 'react'
import { ThemeTransitionProvider, useTheme } from '@/lib/theme'
import { DefaultTheme, ThemeProvider, type Theme } from '@react-navigation/native'
import { Stack } from 'expo-router'
import { StatusBar } from 'expo-status-bar'
import { GestureHandlerRootView } from 'react-native-gesture-handler'

const screenOptions = { headerShown: false } as const

function InnerLayout() {
  const { theme } = useTheme()

  const navTheme: Theme = useMemo(
    () => ({
      dark: theme.scheme === 'dark',
      colors: {
        primary: theme.colors.primary,
        background: theme.colors.background,
        card: theme.colors.card,
        text: theme.colors.text,
        border: theme.colors.border,
        notification: theme.colors.notification,
      },
      fonts: DefaultTheme.fonts,
    }),
    [theme],
  )

  return (
    <ThemeProvider value={navTheme}>
      <StatusBar style={theme.scheme === 'dark' ? 'light' : 'dark'} />
      <Stack screenOptions={screenOptions}>
        <Stack.Screen name="(tabs)" />
      </Stack>
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
}

export default function RootLayout() {
  return (
    <GestureHandlerRootView style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <ThemeTransitionProvider initialTheme="system">
        <InnerLayout />
      </ThemeTransitionProvider>
    </GestureHandlerRootView>
  )
}
```

## How It Works

Three pieces, each with one job.

### 1. `ThemeTransitionProvider`: Captures the Screen for Transitions

Wraps everything that should appear in the snapshot. It's at the
**top** of the tree (inside `GestureHandlerRootView`) so the capture
includes navigation, headers, tabs, and content. Anything rendered
outside this provider won't appear in the overlay and may flash
during the transition.

### 2. `ThemeProvider` From `@react-navigation/native`: Propagates the Theme to Native UI

Without it, every native UI element managed by React Navigation falls
back to the OS system colors. With it, your theme propagates to:

- **Screen container background.** Paints the iOS safe-area zones (top
  status bar area, bottom home indicator area) with your theme color.
  Native-stack reads `navTheme.colors.background` from this provider
  and applies it as `contentStyle.backgroundColor` on every `Screen`
  automatically. Without `ThemeProvider`, `react-native-screens` uses
  the system default and the insets stay light/dark independent of
  your theme.
- **Native-stack header** background, tint, and title color.
- **Tab bar** background and active/inactive colors.
- **React Navigation's own `useTheme()` hook.** Used by `<Link>` and
  any third-party component that integrates with React Navigation's
  theme.

`navTheme` is wrapped in `useMemo` keyed on `theme` so React
Navigation doesn't tear down its native containers on every parent
re-render, only when the underlying theme actually changes.

### 3. `StatusBar`: Follows `theme.scheme`

`theme.scheme` is always `'light'` or `'dark'`, regardless of how
many themes you've defined or whether the user is in system mode.
That's the right signal for the status bar content (`light` content
on a dark background, `dark` content on a light background).

## Nesting Order

```
GestureHandlerRootView                ← gesture handler root (RN convention)
  └─ ThemeTransitionProvider          ← captures everything below for snapshots
      └─ ThemeProvider                ← propagates theme to React Navigation native UI
          └─ Stack / Tabs             ← your navigation
              └─ Screens              ← inherit theme via React Navigation
```

The order matters: `ThemeTransitionProvider` must be **above**
`ThemeProvider`, because the `useTheme()` call inside `InnerLayout`
is how `navTheme` gets the active colors, and that hook lives on
the library's context.

## Bottom Sheets and Modals

Bottom sheets must be inside the provider so the snapshot captures
their backdrop too:

```tsx
<ThemeTransitionProvider initialTheme="system">
  <BottomSheetModalProvider>
    <App />
  </BottomSheetModalProvider>
</ThemeTransitionProvider>
```

> **Warning.** React Native's built-in `Modal` renders in a separate native window
> and is **not** captured in the snapshot. Theme changes while a modal
> is open will animate only the background tree; the modal contents
> flip instantly. Use a bottom sheet (or any in-tree overlay) instead
> if you need the full transition.
