# Haptics and Analytics

The library exposes three lifecycle callbacks (`onTransitionStart`,
`onTransitionEnd`, and `onThemeChange`), which are exactly the right
hooks for haptics and analytics. Configure them once at the
`createThemeTransition` call site and every transition picks them up,
or pass per-call versions through `setTheme`'s options for one-off
behavior.

## Haptic Feedback

### On Every Animated Transition

```ts title="lib/theme.ts"
import * as Haptics from 'expo-haptics'
import { createThemeTransition } from 'react-native-theme-transition'

export const { ThemeTransitionProvider, useTheme } = createThemeTransition({
  themes: { light, dark },
  onTransitionStart: () => {
Haptics.impactAsync(Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Medium)
  },
})
```

Fires for every animated transition, including system-driven ones.
Skipped for instant switches (`animated: false`); there's nothing to
feel.

### On a Specific Button Only

Pass `onTransitionStart` per call instead of at the config level:

```tsx
import * as Haptics from 'expo-haptics'

function ThemeToggle() {
  const { theme, setTheme } = useTheme()

  return (
<Pressable
  onPress={() => {
        setTheme(theme.name === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light', {
          onTransitionStart: () => {
            Haptics.impactAsync(Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Medium)
          },
        })
  }}
>
  <Text>Toggle</Text>
</Pressable>
  )
}
```

The per-call callback fires **after** the config-level one. See
[Callbacks](../guides/callbacks.md) for the full ordering.

## Analytics

`onThemeChange` is the only callback guaranteed to fire on every code
path: animated, instant, system-driven, and capture-failure
fallbacks. Use it as the single source of truth for tracking.

```ts title="lib/theme.ts"
export const { ThemeTransitionProvider, useTheme } = createThemeTransition({
  themes: { light, dark },
  onThemeChange: (name) => {
analytics.track('theme_changed', { theme: name })
  },
})
```

> **Note.** `onTransitionStart` and `onTransitionEnd` fire only for animated
> transitions and can leave gaps on capture failures. Use them for
> feedback effects, not for "the theme is now X" tracking.

## Disable UI During Transitions

```tsx
function ThemeButton() {
  const { setTheme, isTransitioning } = useTheme()

  return (
<Pressable disabled={isTransitioning} onPress={() => setTheme('dark')}>
  <Text>Switch theme</Text>
</Pressable>
  )
}
```

> **Warning.** Do not change visual styles based on `isTransitioning`, e.g.
> `opacity: isTransitioning ? 0.5 : 1`. The snapshot captures the
> current visual state, and style changes will bleed into the
> cross-fade. Use `disabled` (which doesn't change styling) instead.

### Defer Expensive Renders

If a component does heavy work on every render and you don't need it
visible during the transition, swap it for a placeholder while
`isTransitioning` is `true`:

```tsx
function HeavyChart() {
  const { theme, isTransitioning } = useTheme()

  if (isTransitioning) {
return <View style={{ height: 200, backgroundColor: theme.colors.card }} />
  }

  return <ExpensiveChartComponent colors={theme.colors} />
}
```

The placeholder uses the new theme's color, so it blends with the
overlay's destination state. The expensive chart only re-renders once,
after the animation finishes.
