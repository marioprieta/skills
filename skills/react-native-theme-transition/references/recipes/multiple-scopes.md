# Multiple Theme Scopes

Each call to `createThemeTransition` returns its own provider and
hook backed by a fresh React Context. Instances are fully
independent: separate state, separate animation pipeline, no shared
module-level singletons.

This is useful when you have parts of your app that need different
theme sets, for example:

- A multi-tenant dashboard where each organization picks its own
  theme palette.
- A learning app with a parent area and a kid area that should look
  visually distinct.
- An onboarding flow with its own brand colors before the user
  enters the main app.

## Pattern

Define each scope in its own file. Export the provider and hook
under unique names so consumers can pick which one they want.

```ts title="lib/marketing-theme.ts"
import { createThemeTransition } from 'react-native-theme-transition'

const light = { background: '#ffffff', text: '#000000', accent: '#ff6b6b' }
const dark: Record<keyof typeof light, string> = {
  background: '#0a0a0a',
  text: '#ffffff',
  accent: '#ff6b6b',
}

export const {
  ThemeTransitionProvider: MarketingThemeProvider,
  useTheme: useMarketingTheme,
} = createThemeTransition({ themes: { light, dark } })
```

```ts title="lib/app-theme.ts"
import { createThemeTransition } from 'react-native-theme-transition'

const light = { background: '#f5f5f7', text: '#1d1d1f', accent: '#0066cc' }
const dark: Record<keyof typeof light, string> = {
  background: '#000000',
  text: '#f5f5f7',
  accent: '#2997ff',
}

export const {
  ThemeTransitionProvider: AppThemeProvider,
  useTheme: useAppTheme,
} = createThemeTransition({ themes: { light, dark } })
```

## Mounting

Wrap each section of the tree with the matching provider. The
providers do not interfere with each other and can be siblings or
nested.

```tsx title="app/_layout.tsx"
import { Stack } from 'expo-router'
import { MarketingThemeProvider } from '@/lib/marketing-theme'
import { AppThemeProvider } from '@/lib/app-theme'

export default function RootLayout() {
  return (
    <Stack screenOptions={{ headerShown: false }}>
      <Stack.Screen name="(marketing)" options={{ /* ... */ }}>
        {() => (
          <MarketingThemeProvider initialTheme="system">
            <Stack />
          </MarketingThemeProvider>
        )}
      </Stack.Screen>
      <Stack.Screen name="(app)">
        {() => (
          <AppThemeProvider initialTheme="system">
            <Stack />
          </AppThemeProvider>
        )}
      </Stack.Screen>
    </Stack>
  )
}
```

Each component reads from the matching hook:

```tsx title="app/(marketing)/landing.tsx"
import { useMarketingTheme } from '@/lib/marketing-theme'

export default function Landing() {
  const { theme } = useMarketingTheme()
  return <View style={{ backgroundColor: theme.colors.background }} />
}
```

```tsx title="app/(app)/home.tsx"
import { useAppTheme } from '@/lib/app-theme'

export default function Home() {
  const { theme } = useAppTheme()
  return <View style={{ backgroundColor: theme.colors.background }} />
}
```

## Important Caveats

- **`Appearance.setColorScheme` is global to the OS.** Each scope
  calls `Appearance.setColorScheme` independently, so the most
  recently active provider wins. If a screen with the marketing
  provider is on top while a screen with the app provider is in the
  background, the OS native UI tracks the marketing provider. This
  is rarely a problem in practice because only one scope is visible
  at a time.
- **Snapshot capture is per-provider.** Each provider's overlay
  only captures content inside its own subtree. Triggering a
  transition from a child of `MarketingThemeProvider` will only
  animate the marketing region; siblings rendered under
  `AppThemeProvider` are unaffected.
- **Both providers must be mounted before the user can call their
  hooks.** Calling `useMarketingTheme()` from a component outside
  `MarketingThemeProvider` throws the standard
  `useTheme must be used inside a ThemeTransitionProvider` error.

## When NOT to Use Multiple Scopes

If you just want different colors per route or per component,
prefer a single provider with a richer theme map. Multiple scopes
add architectural complexity and only make sense when the theme
sets are genuinely orthogonal (different brands, different
audiences, different contexts).
