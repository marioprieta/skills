## iOS picker flickering during transition

**Symptom:** On iOS, a theme picker with highlighted buttons flickers during the
cross-fade — the selection indicator alternates between the old and new button
positions. More visible with 3+ themes on ProMotion (120Hz) displays.

**Cause:** Calling `setSelected()` and `setTheme()` synchronously in the same
event handler doesn't give React enough time to paint the selection change before
the library captures the screenshot. The screenshot captures the old selection,
the real UI shows the new selection, and the cross-fade blends both — producing
visible flickering for discrete UI elements like button highlights.

**Fix:** Use `useTheme({ initialSelection })`, which handles the timing automatically:

```tsx
const { selected, select, colors, isTransitioning } = useTheme({ initialSelection: 'system' });

// In your button:
<Pressable onPress={() => select(option)} disabled={isTransitioning}>
```

If you're managing selection state manually, defer `setTheme` by one animation
frame so the selection highlight is painted before capture:

```tsx
setSelected(option);
requestAnimationFrame(() => {
  setTheme(option);
});
```

See [Recipes: Theme picker](recipes.md#theme-picker-with-selection-tracking) for
complete examples.

## Native Switch flickers during theme transition

**Symptom:** On iOS, a native `<Switch>` toggles mid-animation in the screenshot,
causing the thumb to appear in an intermediate position during the cross-fade.

**Cause:** iOS's `UISwitch` runs a ~250ms Core Animation that has no completion
callback and cannot be intercepted from JS. `react-native-view-shot` uses
`drawViewHierarchyInRect:afterScreenUpdates:YES` which captures the on-screen
visual state — including the thumb mid-slide. This is a fundamental incompatibility
between native Switch and screenshot-based transitions.

**Fix:** Use a custom toggle with `useTheme({})` and **plain React styles**
(no Reanimated). The toggle thumb is a selection indicator — like a picker
highlight — so it needs the same treatment: update the visual state **before**
the screenshot capture.

```tsx
const { selected, select, colors, isTransitioning } = useTheme({});
const isDark = selected === 'dark';

// select() updates selected → React commits new styles → 1 rAF → setTheme → capture
<Pressable onPress={() => select(isDark ? 'light' : 'dark')} disabled={isTransitioning}>
  <View style={{ backgroundColor: isDark ? colors.primary : colors.border }}>
    <View style={{ transform: [{ translateX: isDark ? MAX_TX : 0 }] }} />
  </View>
</Pressable>
```

> **Why plain styles, not Reanimated?** Reanimated's `useAnimatedStyle` +
> `useEffect` → `sharedValue` adds 1+ frames of latency (JS → UI thread
> pipeline). The capture can fire before the native view updates. Plain
> React styles update in the same commit as `select`, matching the
> pattern that works for pickers and checkmark lists.
>
> **Why not a hardcoded delay?** iOS's UISwitch animation duration is private
> API with no completion callback. A `setTimeout` would be fragile across
> devices, refresh rates, and accessibility settings. No production app or
> library combines native Switch with screenshot-based transitions.

See [Recipes: Theme toggle](recipes.md#theme-toggle) for a complete example.

## Overlay stays visible / app seems frozen

**Symptom:** The screen appears frozen — touches don't work, the UI is stuck showing
the old theme.

**Cause:** The transition state failed to clean up. Most likely `captureRef` threw
and the error wasn't caught, or the component unmounted mid-transition.

**Check:**
- Look for `[react-native-theme-transition] Failed to capture screenshot` in the
  console. If present, the library fell back to instant switch — the overlay should
  have been removed. If it wasn't, check for race conditions with unmounting.
- Verify `react-native-view-shot` is properly installed. Run `npx expo doctor`
  or check native linking.
- Ensure the root `View` inside the provider has `collapsable={false}` (set
  internally — if you've forked the library, verify this).

## Flash on theme change (no animation)

**Symptom:** Theme changes instantly with a visible flash instead of a smooth
cross-fade.

**Causes:**

1. **`animated: false`** — Check if you're passing `{ animated: false }` in options.

2. **Provider placement** — If `ThemeTransitionProvider` doesn't wrap the full
   visible tree, the screenshot only captures part of the screen. The transition
   still runs but looks broken.

3. **`react-native-view-shot` not installed** — `captureRef` throws, the library
   falls back to instant switch. Check console for the warning message.

4. **Missing worklets plugin** — `react-native-worklets/plugin` must be the last
   plugin in `babel.config.js`. Without it, the `withTiming` callback can't
   bridge back to the JS thread.

**Fix:** Verify the provider wraps everything (above navigation), all peer
dependencies are installed, and babel is configured correctly. Restart with
cache clear: `npx expo start -c`.

---

## Duplicate plugin/preset detected (babel error)

**Symptom:** `SyntaxError: index.ts: Duplicate plugin/preset detected.`

**Cause:** Starting from **Expo SDK 55**, `babel-preset-expo` already includes
`react-native-reanimated/plugin` internally. Adding it again in your
`babel.config.js` plugins array causes the duplicate error. This only affects
SDK 55+ — on SDK 54 and below you still need to add it manually.

**Fix:** On SDK 55+, remove `'react-native-reanimated/plugin'` from your plugins —
only keep `'react-native-worklets/plugin'`:

```js
plugins: [
  // SDK 55+: babel-preset-expo already includes reanimated/plugin
  // SDK 54 and below: add 'react-native-reanimated/plugin' here
  'react-native-worklets/plugin', // must be last
],
```

---

## Cannot find module 'babel-preset-expo'

**Symptom:** `SyntaxError: index.ts: Cannot find module 'babel-preset-expo'`

**Cause:** Expo SDK 55 blank templates no longer include `babel-preset-expo` as a
dependency. If you create a `babel.config.js` referencing it, the bundler can't
resolve it.

**Fix:** Install it explicitly:

```bash
npx expo install babel-preset-expo
```

---

## System theme not following OS

**Symptom:** Changing OS appearance (Settings → Dark Mode) doesn't update the app.

**Causes:**

1. **System mode not activated** — Verify you passed `initialTheme="system"` or
   called `setTheme('system')`.

2. **Manual setTheme overrides** — Calling `setTheme('dark')` exits system mode.
   Any subsequent OS changes are ignored until `setTheme('system')` is called again.

3. **Missing `systemThemeMap`** — If themes aren't named `'light'`/`'dark'`, the
   library can't map OS appearance to your themes. Provide `systemThemeMap` in
   the config.

4. **iOS Simulator** — Toggle in Settings → Developer → Appearance, or use
   `Cmd+Shift+A` in the simulator.

---

## Type errors on colors

**Symptom:** `Property 'myToken' does not exist on type '{ ... }'`

**Cause:** The token doesn't exist in your theme definition, or your theme
definitions have mismatched keys.

**Fix:** Ensure all themes share identical keys. Use `Record<keyof typeof light, string>`
on secondary themes:

```ts
const light = { bg: '#fff', text: '#000' };
const dark: Record<keyof typeof light, string> = { bg: '#000', text: '#fff' };
```

---

## Error: themes must contain at least one theme

Pass at least one theme to `createThemeTransition`:

```ts
createThemeTransition({ themes: { light: { bg: '#fff' } } });
```

---

## Error: system is a reserved name

You have a theme named `'system'`. Rename it:

```ts
// Wrong:
themes: { system: { ... }, dark: { ... } }

// Right:
themes: { light: { ... }, dark: { ... } }
```

---

## Error: different token keys

Theme `"dark"` has different keys than `"light"`. Check for typos or missing
tokens. All themes must have the exact same keys.

---

## Error: systemThemeMap maps to non-existent theme

Your `systemThemeMap` references a theme name that doesn't exist in `themes`.
Check for typos:

```ts
// Wrong — 'midnght' is a typo:
systemThemeMap: { light: 'sunrise', dark: 'midnght' }

// Right:
systemThemeMap: { light: 'sunrise', dark: 'midnight' }
```

---

## Error: initialTheme resolved to non-existent theme

`initialTheme="system"` resolved to `'light'` or `'dark'` (from the OS), but no
theme with that name exists. Provide `systemThemeMap`:

```ts
createThemeTransition({
  themes: { sunrise, midnight },
  systemThemeMap: { light: 'sunrise', dark: 'midnight' },
});
```

---

## Error: setTheme('system') resolved to non-existent theme

Same as above but at runtime. Add `systemThemeMap` to your config.

---

## Error: useTheme must be used inside a ThemeTransitionProvider

You're calling `useTheme()` in a component that isn't a descendant of
`ThemeTransitionProvider`. Common causes:

- The provider is missing from the root layout
- The component renders outside the provider tree (e.g., in an error boundary
  above the provider, or in a separate React root)
- Import path mismatch — make sure you import `useTheme` from your theme file,
  not directly from `react-native-theme-transition`

## Theme changes but no animation plays

**Symptom:** Colors update correctly but there's no cross-fade effect.

**Causes:**

1. **`duration: 0`** — The animation is instant. Set a positive duration.
2. **`animated: false` in options** — Check all `setTheme` call sites.
3. **System-driven change in background** — Background changes use instant switch
   by design (no visible animation when the app isn't visible).
4. **Bridge calling setTheme on mount** — If the bridge fires an instant `useEffect`
   on first render and the theme is different from `initialTheme`, you get an
   immediate switch. This is normal behavior on first load.

---

## setTheme does nothing

**Symptom:** Calling `setTheme` has no visible effect.

**Causes:**

1. **Same theme** — `setTheme('dark')` when already on `'dark'` returns `false`.
2. **During transition** — `setTheme` during an ongoing transition returns `false`.
   Wait for `isTransitioning` to become `false`. Note: `setTheme('system')` during
   a transition does **not** activate system mode — the call is fully rejected.
   Retry after the transition completes.
3. **System mode dedup** — `setTheme('system')` when the OS-resolved theme matches
   the current theme activates system mode but doesn't trigger a visual change.

---

## Double transition on app start

**Symptom:** The app starts with one theme, then immediately transitions to another.

**Cause:** `initialTheme` resolves to one theme (e.g., `'system'` → `'light'`), then
a bridge component fires `setTheme` with a different stored preference (e.g., `'dark'`),
triggering an animated transition.

**Fixes:**

1. **Pass the stored preference as `initialTheme`:**
   ```tsx
   const themePreference = useThemeStore((s) => s.themePreference);
   <ThemeTransitionProvider initialTheme={themePreference}>
   ```

2. **Use instant switch in bridge for first render:**
   ```tsx
   const isFirstRender = useRef(true);
   useEffect(() => {
     setTheme(themePreference, { animated: !isFirstRender.current });
     isFirstRender.current = false;
   }, [themePreference, setTheme]);
   ```

## Android: capture returns blank or wrong content

**Symptom:** The screenshot is blank or shows the wrong content on Android.

**Causes:**

1. **`collapsable` not set** — The root View needs `collapsable={false}` to prevent
   Android from flattening it. The library sets this internally, but if you've
   forked or modified the provider, verify it's there.

2. **Hardware acceleration issues** — Some Android devices have issues with
   `react-native-view-shot`. The library uses `format: 'jpg'` with `quality: 0.8`
   for faster captures. If captures fail, the library falls back to an instant
   theme switch automatically.

3. **View not fully rendered** — If the capture happens before the view is laid out,
   it returns blank. The library waits 1 frame before capture to prevent this.
